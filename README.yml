        Daily over 20 terabytes of data get generated of different key
        weather-related parameters like wind speeds, temperature
        readings , satellite images, barometric pressure from
        different locations. Yet the extreme weather events cause huge
        amount of loss and damage worldwide. For instance, 90 percent
        of the crop losses are due to weather calamities all over the
        world. The ability to better predict the weather could slash
        this by up to 25 percent.  The ability to use the big data
        generated efficiently directly affects the chances to reduce
        economic loss, environmental damage and fatality.  This can be
        considered as the best motivation to improve and invest in
        this extremely challenging task.
