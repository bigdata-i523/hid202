\begin{abstract}
Data Visualization is the term used for knowing the visual context of data in order to understand its significance. How to unravel the strands of big data to pick out the relevant parts. If we have multiple sources of data how do we know where to look. Data visualization is the solution to all these questions. It helps to convert information into knowledge. Businesses are using big data in order to better understand their customers and to optimize their business processes. In order to find the meaning, tell the story and sharing the story, visualization is needed where data meets design.

\section{Introduction} 

Data visualization is emerging as an important fusion of graphics, scientific visualization, database and human-computer interaction. Data visualization if properly aligned can provide a shorter route for decision making and a way of conveying critical information. For the data visualization to be truly productive, it has to be interactive, meaningful, understandable, user friendly and approachable. The main advantage of data visualization is that it provide insights into complex data sets by communicating their key aspects \cite{Intro01}.Not only insights, it allows users to see different perspective of the data, offers ability to note exceptions in the data, equips users with ability to see influences that would be difficult to find otherwise, helps users finding nuances that are significant \cite{Intro02}. \\

According to Friedman (2008) the ``main goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and effectively through graphical means. It doesn't mean that data visualization needs to look boring to be functional or extremely sophisticated to look beautiful. To convey ideas effectively, both aesthetic form and functionality need to go hand in hand, providing insights into a rather sparse and complex data set by communicating its key-aspects in a more intuitive way. Yet designers often fail to achieve a balance between form and function, creating gorgeous data visualizations which fail to serve their main purpose $-$ to communicate information'' \cite{Intro03}.\\

Simple form of data visualization include graphs, pi charts, histograms, scatter plots, and maps. Colors can be used to show correlation, size to show quantity, and orientations used to show trends. Design is used to better communicate varied sorts of information, processes, hierarchy, anamoly and analogy. Tables \ref{table1} and \ref{table2} shows basic type of visualization diagrams with their usage.

\section{Data Visualization Tools}

Visualization solutions are rapidly evolving. Some of the most popular and innovative data visualization tools are : 
\subsection*{Tableau}

Tableau is a data visualization tool created by Tableau Software. Tableau’s data visualization is considered to be more interactive than the ones provided by the general BI solutions. The huge and fast changing datasets used in big data operations, artificial intelligence and machine learning can be handled efficiently because of the integration of tableau with various advance database solutions like Teradata, SAP, Amazon AWS, Hadoop. Tableau offers 5 main products: Tableau Desktop,Tableau Server, Tableau Online, Tableau Reader, Tableau Public \cite{Tableau}.\\

\subsection*{Qlikview}

Qlikview is the business discovery platform. It offers powerful business intelligence, analytics and enterprise reporting capabilities other than the data visualization capabilities. It has a clean and clutter free user interface. It is used with Qliksense, which is responsible for data exploration and discovery. Dynamic calculation is the major innovation in Qlikview. It generate new views of information as the users clicks or taps, and instantly responds with the newly calculated set of data and visualizations \cite{Qlikview}.

\subsection*{Spotfire}

Tibco spotfire is the tool used for business intelligence. It is used by predictive analytics professionals to make imperative decisions. It has a library that helps in transferring analysis that has occurred by hard practices from an expert to business user. It not only increase the speed of decision making but also delivers framework for circulation of analysis applications, that depends on the needs of an association. It also make access to the server based data sources easy, since it has its own analytics servers centrally coped information facilities. It has self configuring visual data analysis environment that helps users to explore, visualize and query data in real time \cite{Spotfire}.

\subsection*{MS BI Stack}

Microsoft BI Stack provides all the tools we need to build, manage and use a BI solution, as part of Microsoft SQL Server, Sharepoint and Office applications. Visual studio 2015 can be used to get business insights on a platform that is designed to work with the data, systems and tools. For the enterprises using Microsoft technologies, Microsoft BI stack seems to be the most logical extension. Microsoft has products for data integration(SSIS), analytics(SSAS), business intelligence(SSRS), and visualization. These tools can be used as a stand alone tool or it can be integrated with sharepoint system or MS office desktop products(like Excel) \cite{MS}.

\subsection*{IBM Cognos Analytics }

Cognos Analytics addresses the need for autonomous analytics for business users by allowing them self service analytics.It allows business users to upload and analyze data within an enterprise environment. It has an intuitive web-based interface, so desktop applications, report reader applications, additional browser plugins need not be maintained. Reports can also be authored on mobile devices without having to compromise with security. It is also available on the cloud as a service. Even if we are not sure about the tables to be used for pulling data to build a particular report, IBM's Watson will use meta data from tables and column names of that type of report, to figure out what we might need to use \cite{cognos}. 

\subsection*{SAP Lumira}

SAP Lumira is the advancement of SAP tool Visual Intelligence. It enables business users to access, transform and visualize data of any size. It allows self service analytics. We can visualize any amount of data in real time using SAP HANA and simple deployment to mobile devices. It allows to import data from excel and multiple other sources, performing visual BI analytics using intuitive dashboards, and securely sharing insights and data stories. One of the powerful element of Lumira is Infographics. Users can prepare data themselves without using code or scripts and thus reducing IT time and cost \cite{SAP}.



\section{Comparison of some Data Visualization products}

Big data can be best comprehended using interactive Data Visualization which has drill down capabilities and dashboards. Among the several DV products available in the market, each has its place. For example, Spotfire has best web client and analytical functionality, Qlikview has best interactive drilldown capabilities, Microsoft BI platform gives best price performance ratio, whereas Tableau has best ability to interact with OLAP cubes \cite{compare}.\\ The tables \ref{table:comparision1} and \ref{table:comparision} will show these 4 DV product comparison on the basis of business and technical criteria.


\section{Conclusion}

Designing an efficient and effective data visualization application is a complex process. Also good visualization requires customization. This process involves representing the data of interest, processing the data to extract relevant information for the problem at hand, designing a mapping of this information to a visual representation, rendering this representation, and combining all this functionality in an easy-to-use application. Visualization is taking an advantage of the fact that we humans are programmed to understand the world around us on the basis of what we see. So it should tell a story with a subject, a function and a desired output.\\

For even smaller data sets, visualization can provide insights that leads to better data, and in turn to better visualizations. This positive loop can be considered as a core of complex and interactive data visualization and both end products keep on refining with each iteration.
