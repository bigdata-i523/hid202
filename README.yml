        Daily over 20 terabytes of data get generated of different key
        weather-related parameters like wind speeds, temperature
        readings , satellite images, barometric pressure from
        different locations. Yet the extreme weather events cause huge
        amount of loss and damage worldwide. For instance, 90 percent
        of the crop losses are due to weather calamities all over the
        world. The ability to better predict the weather could slash
        this by up to 25 percent.  The ability to use the big data
        generated efficiently directly affects the chances to reduce
        economic loss, environmental damage and fatality.  This can be
        considered as the best motivation to improve and invest in
        this extremely challenging task.

              Data Visualization is the term used for knowing the visual context
              of data in order to understand its significance. How to unravel the
              strands of big data to pick out the relevant parts. If we have multiple
              sources of data how do we know where to look. Data visualization is 
              the solution to all these questions. It helps to convert information
              into knowledge. Businesses are using big data in order to better 
              understand their customers and to optimize their business processes. 
              In order to find the meaning, tell the story and sharing the story, 
              visualization is needed where data meets design.
